# CSOC-ML-Week-2-Assignment
Wisconsin Breast Cancer Prediction using Neural Networks in Tensorflow

This repository consists of a breast cancer predictor (whether it is benign/malignant) in the city of Wisconsin. This was the first assignment given to us in CSOC, held by Club of Programmers, IIT-BHU Varanasi.

The model was trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset provided to us by the mentors. The dataset consisted of many features along with the patient id and the diagnosis(Benign/Malignant). The model used was an artificial neural network made by using Tensorflow with Keras API.

The Breast Cancer Predictor.ipynb file consists of the formation and training of the model along with the predictor function which evaluates the features and outputs the result. The model which is used has been saved in the wbcd.h5 file and predictions have been made using that particular file. Comments have been added to the file for better understanding of the code.

The dataset is available in the wbcd.csv file.
